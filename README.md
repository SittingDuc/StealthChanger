<em>Tool changing system for Vorons and other front mount printer motion systems.<em>

<table comment="two-column layout"><tr><td width="80%">

## Stealthchanger Overview
StealthChanger is a project to convert a Voron 2.4 printer into one with multiple toolheads.

Mounting of the toolhead to the shuttle is done by using bushings and pins, with magnets to help create a strong mounting connection for high-speed printing, and uses the same principles as [TAP](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Tap) to measure Z offsets.

StealthChanger draws from many different projects including [tapchanger](https://github.com/viesturz/tapchanger), and involves the contributions of many people who work together to make it better. 

## Stealthchanger Components
The stealthchanger system consists of multiple parts. Some are essential, some have many different options, and some are optional.

The shuttle replaces your Voron shuttle with one that has bushings to connect to the backplate of each toolhead

</td></tr>
 
<tr><td valign="top" width="400px"><h3>Modular Dock</h3>
This mounts to the top front of your printer to hold/dock the toolheads when not in use. May also contain a crossbar at the bottom of the dock. Some docks just use the crossbar.
<ul>
<li>Crossbar [optional]</li>
<li>Modular Dock</li>
<li>Door buffer [optional]. Needed if mounting crossbar to front of frame.</li>

<tr><td valign="top" width="400px"><h3>Electronics and cable management system</h3>
Mounts a CAN or USB distribution board on the back of the printer, and manages all the cables and PTFE tubes going to the toolheads.

<li>FannyPack</li>
<li>Umbilicals</li>

## Planning
- Make sure to visit our [Checklist](Checklist)
- Tool compatability
Currently we support the standard Stealth Burner, Dragon Burner, Rapid Burner, Yavoth, XOL and Archetype. There is also a usermod for the [Mini Stealth Burner](../blob/main/UserMods/jdmontgomer/MiniSB_SC).
