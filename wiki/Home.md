<em>Tool changing system for Vorons and other front mount printer motion systems.<em>

## Stealthchanger Overview
StealthChanger is a project to convert a Voron 2.4 printer into one with multiple toolheads.

Mounting of the toolhead to the shuttle is done by using bushings and pins, with magnets to help create a strong mounting connection for high-speed printing, and uses the same principles as [TAP](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Tap) to measure Z offsets.

StealthChanger draws from many different projects including [tapchanger](https://github.com/viesturz/tapchanger), and involves the contributions of many people who contribute to make it better. 

## Stealthchanger Components

The stealthchanger system consists of multiple parts. Some are essential, some have many different options, and some are optional. 

### Shuttle & Backplate

## Planning
- Make sure to visit our [Checklist](Checklist)
- Tool compatability
Currently we support the standard Stealth Burner, Dragon Burner, Rapid Burner, Yavoth, XOL and Archetype. There is also a usermod for the [Mini Stealth Burner](../blob/main/UserMods/jdmontgomer/MiniSB_SC).
