# Xol Toolhead

## Reference
[Xol reference page](https://github.com/Armchair-Heavy-Industries/Xol-Toolhead)

## Backplate

[Backplate (short/medium)](https://github.com/DraftShift/StealthChanger/tree/main/STLs/Backplates)

## Backplate BOM for All Tools

- [4] m3 heat inserts
- [3] Ã˜4x12mm ssRod (dowel pin) with a rounded end **(if it has female threads on the back it will be listed as an M3, but make sure the pin is 4mm OD, that is what is important. We recommend the threaded pins for better fixing)**
- [1] 6x3mm magnet (N52 Highly recommended to counter the pull from the umbilicals. Note that most magnets not from a reputable source may say N52 but aren't actually. Recommend one of the two links below.)
- [2] m3x6 or m3x8 FHCS (Flat head countersunk screw, MUST BE MAGNETIC. no stainless, as per TAP)
- [1] [OptoTap](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DEGsGTV) (only the sensor PCB is required)
- [1] m3x8 BHCS (optional in v1.1)


### BOM Additions for Stealthburner
- [2] m3x6 BHCS (backplate lower mounting screws. m3x8 will be too long)
- [2] m3x20 BHCS (backplate upper mounting screws)
- [2] m3x8 BHCS (extruder mount to backplate)
- [2] m3x6 FHCS **magnetic** (preload screws. m3x8 will be too long)
- You will **not be able** to use stock 2.4 Z joints with Xol or A4T.
- Replacement of your Z joints with something with a lower profile such as [hartk123's GE5C Z Joint](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/main/printer_mods/hartk1213/Voron2.4_GE5C) or [Ellis'Short Z Joints](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/main/printer_mods/Ellis/Short_Z_Joints) is necessary to avoid bottoming out your Z carriage on the deck panel when using Xol or A4T.

## StealthChanger Requirements
* ***Requires*** Shorter Z joints like <a href="https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/main/printer_mods/hartk1213/Voron2.4_GE5C">Ge5C z-joints</a> so you don't bottom out your carriage when homing.
