# Software

this page should give an overview of the software, plus:
* Detailed klipper-toolchanger and/or KTE install instructions
* Any configureation needed for the SW
* links to next pages for config or calibration?

Previous notes:

Sounds like I should use "Klipper-toolchanger-easy" instead of the default repo.  
* https://github.com/jwellman80/klipper-toolchanger-easy?tab=readme-ov-file
* Even when using klipper-toolchanger-easy, use the examples in the [Draftshift Klipper-toolchanger folder](https://github.com/DraftShift/klipper-toolchanger)
* Klipper-toolchanger-easy is just for installation.  After installing that, still follow the [stealthchanger wiki](https://github.com/DraftShift/StealthChanger/wiki/Calibration) for configuration and setup!
* Nudge XY calibration
* [Dock Tuner macro]((https://github.com/Contomo/klipper-toolchanger-hard/blob/main/examples/dock%20location/fixed/dock_tuner.cfg)  how to install?
* LEDs: [Example from Draftshift](https://github.com/DraftShift/klipper-toolchanger?tab=readme-ov-file) designs page
* [LED Effects](https://github.com/julianschill/klipper-led_effect) TBD

SW Setup issues:
* if using "fan0 or fan2" from slicer, need to change those back to named fans.
