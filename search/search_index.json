It involves placing a regular piece of \"copy machine paper\" between the printer's bed and nozzle, and then commanding the nozzle to different Z heights until one feels a small amount of friction when pushing the paper back and forth.</p> <p>It is important to understand the \"paper test\" even if one has an \"automatic Z probe\". The probe itself often needs to be calibrated to get good results. That probe calibration is done using this \"paper test\".</p> <p>In order to perform the paper test, cut a small rectangular piece of paper using a pair of scissors (eg, 5x3 cm). The paper generally has a thickness of around 100 microns (0.100mm). (The exact thickness of the paper isn't crucial.)</p> <p>The first step of the paper test is to inspect the printer's nozzle and bed. Make sure there is no plastic (or other debris) on the nozzle or bed.</p> <p>Inspect the nozzle and bed to ensure no plastic is present!</p> <p>If one always prints on a particular tape or printing surface then one may perform the paper test with that tape/surface in place. However, note that tape itself has a thickness and different tapes (or any other printing surface) will impact Z measurements. Be sure to rerun the paper test to measure each type of surface that is in use.</p> <p>If there is plastic on the nozzle then heat up the extruder and use a metal tweezers to remove that plastic. Wait for the extruder to fully cool to room temperature before continuing with the paper test. While the nozzle is cooling, use the metal tweezers to remove any plastic that may ooze out.</p> <p>Always perform the paper test when both nozzle and bed are at room temperature!</p> <p>When the nozzle is heated, its position (relative to the bed) changes due to thermal expansion. This thermal expansion is typically around a 100 microns, which is about the same thickness as a typical piece of printer paper. The exact amount of thermal expansion isn't crucial, just as the exact thickness of the paper isn't crucial. Start with the assumption that the two are equal (see below for a method of determining the difference between the two distances).</p> <p>It may seem odd to calibrate the distance at room temperature when the goal is to have a consistent distance when heated. However, if one calibrates when the nozzle is heated, it tends to impart small amounts of molten plastic on to the paper, which changes the amount of friction felt. That makes it harder to get a good calibration. Calibrating while the bed/nozzle is hot also greatly increases the risk of burning oneself. The amount of thermal expansion is stable, so it is easily accounted for later in the calibration process.</p> <p>Use manual controls to move the tool</p> <p>Using the webUI (Mainsail, Fluidd, Octoprint) or the LCD Controls, move the tool down and stop just before the bed.  Place the paper between the nozzle and bed. It can be useful to fold a corner of the paper so that it is easier to grab. (Try not to push down on the bed when moving the paper back and forth.) Continue to jog the tool down 0.1 at a time. After the nozzle stops moving, push the paper back and forth to check if the nozzle is in contact with the paper and to feel the amount of friction.</p> <p>If too much friction is found then jog up be smaller increments.</p> <p>Once you are happy with the results note the Z position (you may also use <code>M114</code> to get the location).</p> <p>Taken from Klipper paper test</p>"},{"location":"Checklist/","title":"Checklist","text":"<ul> <li>[ ] Read and understand all the documentation</li> <li>[ ]  Decide on the tools to use, See Docks for a calculation of how many will fit</li> <li>[ ] Decide on dock types, Modular Dock or other</li> <li>[ ] Decide if you are going top mount, or use a cross bar, 2040 or Door Buffer or MiniBFI</li> <li>[ ] Decide on a Tophat</li> <li>[ ] Decide on umbilical management WIP</li> <li>[ ] Visit the BOM to make sure you have ordered everything you need for the convertion</li> <li>[ ] Visit our Printing guide and start printing</li> <li>[ ] At this point please inspect your prints, take extra note that your hexes are very uniform, if the tops are flat you will have alignment issues, it doesn't take much for things to start off wrong here.</li> <li>[ ] Assemble the shuttle and backplates</li> <li>[ ] Install software</li> <li>[ ] Configure software</li> <li>[ ] Calibrate Z Offsets</li> <li>[ ] Calibrate Dock Parking</li> <li>[ ] Calibrate X/Y Offsets</li> <li>[ ] Registrer for a serial</li> <li>[ ] Visit our sponsor page</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Configuration/","title":"Configuration","text":"<p>Toolchangers start with number 0, and count up.

There is gcode_(x/y/z)_offset in the [tool] section, and (x/y/z)_offset in the [tool_probe] section. These do different things. The ones in the [tool] section are always relative to a specific tool. IE, if you homed with T0, then the gcode offsets are relative to T0. When you do multi-material prints, you will have to choose 1 tool to always do the homing, even if you don't use it, because all the other offsets need to be set against it. The [tool_probe] offset is only ever applied when homing with that tool. The gcode offsets are applied when changing a tool.</p> <p>You should set all the <code>[tool_probe]</code> offsets as well though. If you are only using a single tool, you can home with that tool, and it will use the offset in the <code>[tool_probe]</code> section. You won't need to home with your primary tool first then before you start a print. </p> <p>To try and further clarify. Lets say you have 3 tools, T0, T1, and T2. We will say that T0 is your \"primary\" tool. Setup the probe z_offset like you would any other printer. Make sure the offset is set in <code>z_offset</code> (IE, make sure when you home and go to Z 0, the nozzle is actually in that spot). Its location in x/y/z is always going to be 0 in relation to the other tools. So after T0 is homed, T1 and T2 (may) need to have their <code>gcode_(x/y/z)_offset</code> changed so they match the location that the primary tool actually is. There are 2 main ways of doing this. You can use a test print to print layers on top of or next to each other (something like this: Nozzle Alignment Assist) or you can use a camera (something like kTAMV Klipper Tool Alignment or IDEX Nozzle Calibration Tool).</p>"},{"location":"Configuration/#dock-positions","title":"Dock Positions","text":"<p>When setting your dock position in your tool config, X and Y are pretty self explanatory.
